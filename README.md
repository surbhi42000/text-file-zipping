# Text-File-Zipper
* Implemented Huffman Encoding Algorithm to compress .txt files.
* Used frequency dictionary, min heap, binary tree for conversion of text to binary encoded codes.
* The binary codes are padded to make it a multiple of 8 and further converted into bytes array.
* The original text is retrived back using reverse frequency dictionary.
* The compression ratio is found to be greater than 1.5 for most of the text files.
